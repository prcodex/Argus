💡 ROSENBERG'S BOTTOM LINE

POSITIONING:
✅ Trimmed gold/silver (prescient before -5-7% drops)
✅ Long UK gilts (paying off with -8bp drop)
✅ Overweight Treasuries (golden cross + weak economy)
⚠️ Cautious equities (euphoria + disconnect)

THESIS:
• Economy weak: 18% expansion, downturn signals, Canada trouble
• Markets euphoric: Citi 0.71, Market Vane 70
• AI masking reality: "Strip out AI, no growth this year"
• Bonds attractive: Technical + fundamental support
• Gold secular bull: Pullback healthy, central bank buying continues
• Equities risky: Valuations + sentiment at extremes

WARNINGS:
• S&P disconnected from real economy
• Tremendous complacency (pervasive belief economy fine)
• Katie Martin: Bubble talk broken confinement
• 80% probability stocks lower after euphoria
